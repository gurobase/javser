### Below is the list of known issues that I intend on fixing whenever I have free time in no particular order of importance. It will be updated as new bugs are discovered and old ones get fixed.

1. Some stream providers are not working as of yet, these will be added with future updates.
2. Scaling is probably bad on anything that is not 1080x1920
