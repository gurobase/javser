JAVser is a free Android app that lets you watch all your favorite JAV on your mobile device without ads.
It's still in beta and of course has some issues (Known issues are mentioned at the bottom).

JAVser is powered by JAVMax's API ([JAVMax website](https://www.javmax.co/en)) and has the same search functionality (if you're familiar with how searching is performed there.

### Below is the list of known issues that I intend on fixing whenever I have free time in no particular order of importance. It will be updated as new bugs are discovered and old ones get fixed.

1. Some stream providers are not working as of yet, these will be added with future updates.
2. The Trending tab doesn't work, because of the issues on JAVMax's developer's end, there's some problem with the API or something.
3. The favorites tab is inverted. Newest videos that you add to favorites get moved to the end of the Favorites list.
